0	the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
1	catch it . . . if you can ! 
0	dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
1	bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
1	leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing . 
1	what makes the movie work — to an admittedly limited extent — is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
1	béart and berling are both superb , while huppert . . . is magnificent . 
1	takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
0	dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
0	waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
1	a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love . 
0	city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
1	compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get . 
1	its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
1	the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
1	this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers . 
1	ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine . 
1	i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . 
0	a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
1	[schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists .

1	a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall . 
1	while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation . 
0	the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
0	with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
0	this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
1	the one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded . 
1	if you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it's informative and breathtakingly spectacular .

0	about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
0	violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
0	authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
0	real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
1	the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional . 
0	[the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
0	mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
1	a movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it's-funny level . 
0	brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
0	laughably , irredeemably awful . 
1	there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy . . . but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty . 
0	almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
1	sparse but oddly compelling . 
1	it's quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer . 
1	if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle . 
0	a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
0	a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
0	the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
0	chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
1	moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
1	hard to resist . 
1	shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
1	a little better than sorcerer's stone . 
0	the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
0	to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
0	has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 
0	a movie to forget
1	suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks' face than his wife is . 
0	feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
1	it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 
0	the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
0	if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
1	campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful . 
0	denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
1	the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 
0	there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
0	the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
0	there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
0	needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
0	even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .

0	no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
1	although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two . 
0	the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
0	ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
0	takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
1	happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
0	benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
0	any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
0	…its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
0	everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
1	like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart . 
0	amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn .

0	the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
1	director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy . 
1	hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare . 
0	it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
0	like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
0	a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
0	a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
1	cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of those days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie . 
0	a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
1	kinnear . . . gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life's ultimate losers . 
0	wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
1	despite its shortcomings , girls can't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 
0	fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .

1	it's all a rather shapeless good time . . . 
1	moving and vibrant . 
1	pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
1	it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia . 
1	this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
0	it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
0	all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
0	moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
0	comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
0	a rather tired exercise in nostalgia . 
1	a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides . 
0	the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
0	at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
1	personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us . 
1	the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard . 
0	collapses under its own meager weight . 
1	a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . 
1	as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc . 
0	[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
1	candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
1	it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
1	as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances . 
0	the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
1	for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough . 
1	although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching . 
1	sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . 
1	 . . . a lesson in prehistoric hilarity . 
0	it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
1	it's stylishly directed with verve . . . 
1	a marvelous performance by allison lohman as an identity-seeking foster child . 
1	this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer . 
1	challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . but it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle . 
1	 . . . myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-tarantino pop-culture riffs . . . 
0	i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .

0	a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . 
1	although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
0	abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
1	ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn .

0	there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
0	while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
1	a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . 
1	 . . . the story , like ravel's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with . 
0	a dreary indulgence . 
0	the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .

0	the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
0	the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
1	the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work .

1	a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age . 
0	we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
1	<em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film . and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today . 
0	the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles . 
0	though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
0	would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 
0	samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
0	it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
1	kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults .

0	beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
1	it's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family . 
1	there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
0	the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
0	a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
1	my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more .

0	predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
0	it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
0	a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
0	simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
1	but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity .

1	rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 . 
0	stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
1	there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .

1	a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system
1	robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows .

1	this version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true , lived experience . 
1	the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( " laissez-passer " ) wears its heart on its sleeve . 
1	the film is . . . determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation .

1	a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
0	the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother .

1	the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film . 
1	go see it and enjoy . 
1	while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
1	it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .

0	a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .

1	if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful .

1	enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers . 
1	nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects . 
1	altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
1	nair's cast is so large it's altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion .

1	despite the predictable parent vs . child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at " the real americans " make this a charmer . 
1	this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride . 
1	a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass . 
0	unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart . 
1	a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional . 
0	shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . . 
0	like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
1	not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 
1	the urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative .

1	one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work . 
1	the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
0	it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
0	despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
1	despite its faults , gangs excels in spectacle and pacing . 
0	eh .

1	the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
0	a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
1	heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
1	surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . 
1	medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
0	if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie .

1	what distinguishes time of favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts . 
0	one of the worst movies of the year . 
1	you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear . 
1	as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me . 
0	an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .

1	what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
0	life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities .
